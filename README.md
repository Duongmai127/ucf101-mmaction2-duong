# ucf101-mmaction2-duong

In this attempt, we fine-tune a pre-trained C3D model to the UCF101 action recognition dataset. 


Check out work_dirs/c3d_sports1m-pretrained_8xb30-16x1x1-45e_ucf101-rgb/c3d_sports1m-pretrained_8xb30-16x1x1-45e_ucf101-rgb.py to see relevant details in training a model (e.g. model architecture, weight initialization, train/val dataset, data pipeline, data loader, optimizer schemes, default hooks)
